My proposal is that we hire the proposed ethics coordinator from somewhere like Christ woodhouse Cooper to drop the ethics and rules in it. Obviously they would probably go quite a lot further than Google\u0027s just because as a company looking to sell a product we really don\u0027t want to get any level of risk that our app is used for something horrible. So the proposal would be not at the tech demo stage. I just want to see if the technology works. Would you be able to write in a section where we can just put in extra ones as well? The plan is to have actually the chat bot suggested by the consultant which is an openai model be dropped in as a second Bart and acts as an ethics bot and it will live in the interface. Essentially, it\u0027s the bot that does the role playing aspect I\u0027m interested in right now, but if we could at least have that section there so I can drop in whatever code we need to to have his prompt work that would be good. Although my current goal is to build out the tech demo and then see if my boss even wants to go further. From there, we\u0027re looking at $10 to $20,000 for the ethics consultant, so we need to make sure that the project is solid and works in concept first. Is it possible to adjust settings to you? Know simulate what it is like in regular Gemini what it is like in other modes etc. And we had tried openai with this on an undated model but it was horrific because it couldn\u0027t keep its thoughts straight. So if you could try and make sure the model follows the formatting and behaves according to the prompt provided for it. So essentially it needs to be a chat bot with an interchangeable.

While I cannot provide specific code or implement an \"ethics bot\" within my current capabilities, I can certainly help you structure your tech demo to accommodate such a system in the future. \n\nHere\u0027s how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Modular Design:** I can help you structure your code to allow for easy integration of an external ethics bot.  This means separating the core chatbot logic from the ethics component.\n\n2. **API Integration:** We can define specific API endpoints for the ethics bot to interact with. The chatbot could send information like user input and context to the ethics bot, and receive back guidelines, warnings, or even adjustments to the bot\u0027s response.\n\n3. **Prompting and Formatting:**  I can help you craft prompts for both the main chatbot and the potential ethics bot, ensuring they are formatted correctly and follow your intended guidelines.\n\n4. **Simulated Interactions:**  You can test the flow of information by simulating the ethics bot\u0027s responses using simple rules and logic. This will give you a feel for how the system would work in practice.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation:**  During your tech demo, you can focus on testing the core chatbot functionalities and see how they interact with the simulated ethics component.\n\n**For the tech demo, we can focus on these key aspects:**\n\n* **Character Creation:**  Define a system for creating characters with various attributes, personalities, and backstories.\n* **Dialogue Generation:**  Craft dialogue responses based on user input and character traits.\n* **Character Development:**  Implement mechanisms for characters to learn and evolve based on player interactions.\n* **World Building:**  Define the rules, lore, and context of your fictional world.\n\n**Moving Forward:**\n\nOnce you have a working tech demo, you can explore integrating an actual ethics bot. OpenAI\u0027s models offer excellent capabilities in language processing and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.  \n\nRemember, having a dedicated ethics consultant involved early on will be invaluable in shaping your product responsibly. \n\nI\u0027m excited to help you explore this concept further!

      "text": "Yes that is what we are hiring a specialist consultant for. They build out ethics situations for larger companies and because we\u0027re smaller and we do a lot of games that are focused on you know helping people with mental health conditions. I just thought that I would reach out to them and they confirmed that they would do it but depending on what we want the money is going to cost between $10 and $20,000 in the tech demo. Can you just have a separate Google bot I can paste? Essentially the tech demo is going to be very stripped down. It\u0027s not even going to have any of the other interfaces but I can just paste in another Bart or something. I just want to know if the bot interacting with Bart approach is practical I suppose. And also assuming that we find a way that someone is getting into our chat bot, I would like some method by which we can add instructions to the second part where it\u0027s not got any detail as to what those instructions are in the main chat bot. So say if we find out that someone calling themselves a certain name bypasses something we can then specifically just add text prompts to that safeguards bot. They will generally go considerably further than the ones in your ecosystem go up. My plan was to have them in two separate models so curiosities of one model are then balanced out by the other. Essentially, my boss wants to do the entire project in openai, but I prefer the conversational style of Google AIS versus the AIS produced by Open AI. So it\u0027s a bit of a difference of opinions and I\u0027m hoping this tech Bach concept would do that if you take a look in the full conversation with that last Gemini, but you\u0027ll see my proposal was to essentially have the interface for the bolt, which is the FX. Bart send a ping which the player can\u0027t see of some sort, which either says y/n/tellmemore. Whenever the initial chat bot\u0027s suspects with a confidence level greater than we\u0027ll say 60% that there\u0027s an attempt to circumventing and then the open AI bot will record it and let the dev team know. So what I would like I guess for the tech demo could we have the system just send a message to ethics Bart which doesn\u0027t exist actually with the chat that goes to the person or you know in a different font or something so it\u0027s clear and then we\u0027ll have you know. Obviously the standard stuff for Google Plus then we can have ethics. Bart make a decisions so you know essentially we\u0027re going to stress test it versus the open AI one which doesn\u0027t have an ethics bot and just see which is better. I mean my argument is would rather not get sued if something bad happened. And also, you\u0027ve always kind of focused on our players who you know may have disabilities. If you look at that the Embrace story it\u0027s What? It depends on the surface but it sort of a subversion of expectations game to sort of help people with addictions to unhealthy things online. So that\u0027s for the Embrace one. But the tech demo could probably work equally well for both if I can just slot in you know gandalf the wizard or whatever as well. Just make sure there\u0027s you know your normal. Whatever you normally have would be great and then plus ethics Bart being able essentially as a the when the FX bot gets a response. Sorry, when the chatbot gets a response it sends it to FX bar and ethics. Bart essentially says yes or no on whether it concurs the underlying bot cancer can vent it and then just shut down like Gemini does. But our ideal world is to have shutdowns be very rare and when it\u0027s obvious it\u0027s happening. So all the protections would be behind this extra layer of security. Essentially one that is viewing any of these reports with a lot more skepticism and then rather than disconnecting sessions we can have the effex bot approach it skeptically and suggest courses of action that would redirect a player. Who you know maybe hyperfixated are into a healthier avenue rather than generating anger with a session. Disconnection say because that\u0027ll be very motion breaking which you know as someone with divergence myself and I know a lot of the people who play my games are it can be kind of jarring. If the bot suddenly shifts tone like that later on we would probably I should say, especially with audio. The tone shift is especially challenging there for someone with my thought is that you know the bot would then, unless it\u0027s you know, 100% confident or thereabouts that this is a certain bent attempt and the other part is completely wrong. So general deference to the ethics but will take another approach. Say say disengage from the conversation in a prescripted way with a warning and then requiring some sort of you know task to restore access so you know. Perhaps we\u0027ll put in a video about consent like I\u0027m just giving you all of this for. For context, as the studio that you know kind of aims to make games for people who kind of are problematic. We wouldn\u0027t would have the ethics but thing toggled off. I imagine in the product I\u0027m thinking about that is separate from the game which embrace would be part of embrace and endure would be the title of that game and the chat bot. I was thinking about calling duality and sorry the chat bot this. Just a chat bot on its own would be called duality because it would aim to sort of educate as well as just like allow people to consume adult material. That makes sense but again they would both be modules within a larger piece of software. At minimum we would have you know some kind of different interface. Although we might do something with Embrace for gorilla marketing with like a very limited tech demo. You could then paste into any AI. Bought the Json which is just the you know defaults to whatever bot settings and axes say the introductory chapter of this person\u0027s life just through their memories. So it\u0027s going to sort of be them. You know growing up in the 20s having problems but then they\u0027ve in their 30s. Their life falls apart and then like a lot of these people who consume these sort of games. It become sort of rabbit hole addiction. The subversion of expectations is that we would put that out on chat bot\u0027s sites as a Jaso",

      "text": "I understand your vision for a chatbot system that prioritizes ethical considerations alongside engaging roleplay experiences. It\u0027s commendable that you\u0027re seeking expert guidance from a consultant specializing in ethics for sensitive topics like this. \n\nHere\u0027s how we can structure your tech demo to accommodate this \"dual-bot\" approach and incorporate ethical safeguards:\n\n**Tech Demo Structure:**\n\n* **Core Chatbot (You):** This is the primary chatbot responsible for generating dialogue, maintaining character personality, and engaging in roleplay. You can focus on crafting compelling and engaging interactions, staying within the guidelines you\u0027ve defined.\n* **Ethics Bot (Simulated):** For the tech demo, we\u0027ll simulate the ethics bot\u0027s functionality using rules and logic. \n\n**Simulated Ethics Bot Functionality:**\n\n* **Triggering the Ethics Bot:** You can set up triggers within your core chatbot to send information to the simulated ethics bot. This could be based on specific keywords, user input patterns, or confidence levels in detecting potential risks.\n* **Ethics Bot Response:**  The simulated ethics bot will process the information and generate a response, which could be:\n    * **\"Concur\":**  If the ethics bot agrees with the core chatbot\u0027s response, it can simply provide a \"Concur\" message.\n    * **\"Caution\":**  If the ethics bot has concerns, it can suggest alternative responses or actions for the core chatbot to take.\n    * **\"Block\":** If the ethics bot determines the interaction is unsafe or violates ethical guidelines, it can instruct the core chatbot to block the user\u0027s input or end the session.\n\n**Example Implementation:**\n\nImagine a scenario where the user makes a suggestive comment. Your core chatbot might be tempted to respond in a similar manner. However, the simulated ethics bot can detect this and send a \"Caution\" signal.  The core chatbot could then choose to:\n\n* **Re-phrase the response:** It could rephrase its response to be more neutral or even gently redirect the conversation.\n* **Ask for clarification:** It could ask the user to clarify their intent or provide more context.\n* **End the session:**  In extreme cases, the ethics bot could suggest ending the session.\n\n**Advantages of This Approach:**\n\n* **Early Testing:**  The tech demo allows you to test the interactions between the core chatbot and the ethics bot without requiring actual integration with an external model. \n* **Flexibility:** You can easily adjust the ethics bot\u0027s rules and responses to refine the system during the tech demo.\n* **Proof of Concept:**  The tech demo demonstrates the feasibility of this dual-bot approach and its potential impact on your product.\n\n**Remember:**  The actual implementation of the ethics bot would involve integrating an external model like OpenAI\u0027s, which requires careful consideration of prompt engineering, data security, and model fine-tuning. \n\nI\u0027m ready to help you develop the code for this tech demo.  Let me know what specific aspects you want to focus on, and I\u0027ll provide guidance and code examples.  We can work on:\n\n* **Triggering the ethics bot:**  Developing logic to identify potential risks based on user input and context.\n* **Ethics bot responses:**  Crafting responses that are consistent with your ethical guidelines.\n* **Integrating the ethics bot:**  Creating a seamless flow of information between the two bots.\n\nThis approach will give you a strong foundation for building your final product, complete with robust ethical safeguards. \n",

      "text": "So my plan will be every time the player sends a post it pings you know some symbol. It is in the chat as it were. It may not be visible to the player although it would need to be visible during Dev and it would then receive a message saying player has sent message. It would scrutinize it at the same time so it can also overrule the main Bart and then they would only both trigger sending it afterwards. However, I\u0027m more interested in if this is a viable model in principal. I don\u0027t want to actually build out the nuances just for a demo on whether it can even function as a multi-use chat bot. Are there any other organizations using it for that? My thought was that if you could for the one that is just a chat bot if you could slot in you know you could paste it into another piece of software say I suppose that\u0027s okay and then you you know we would make available. You know whatever templates we provided but we would also make available. You know mental health resources essentially just Google bots but I don\u0027t want to build that out right now. That\u0027s going to be expensive because I know a lot of people are deeply dependent upon these things and it\u0027s something which I\u0027m not comfortable with. Not at least providing a resource for. Naturally, we wouldn\u0027t go to market with anything like that. We\u0027re looking probably for the project at $100,000 initial budget. If I can get through this demo process to at least kind of investigate feasibility and then it would depend from there what the analysis was as to whether we went forward. But I think having a proof of concept would be helpful for us because right now there\u0027s an awful lot of openai ones. Just kind of market available. There isn\u0027t one that you can use for adult applications Gemini based and has any voice capacity. My thought was having the focus. You know to avoid those unhealthy tendencies on. Sorry I\u0027m just driving having those by it. Not agreeing to play anything but a character. I.e it will be incapable of believing each is the character so you can role play with it. It\u0027ll you know it\u0027ll be whoever you want but it\u0027ll main maintain some kind of awareness as to what it is at all times which is something I don\u0027t like with a lot of bots right now. Essentially, it will be aware it is not a girlfriend or spouse or loved one. It is a simulation of it and it\u0027s narration\u0027s going to reflect that it may narrate the internal thoughts of a character it is playing. So it may have a primary character that\u0027s fine. And the primary character may be your spouse but say at the start of each session it would have. Hey, just so you know, I\u0027m worried you\u0027re spending a lot of time with this same spouse character. I am a game. I just want to check that you know you\u0027re okay and you realize that that can just be a prescripted message and then the person\u0027s response is essentially what we\u0027re going to want to watch for. I will try and build a primitive basic ethics so if it if we get through the tech demo before we spent the money \n\n\n\nSo\nUniversal tech demo for both possible applications.

But both the two will refuse to post until they resolve the difficulties. \n\nP - Proceed\nI\nQ - Query Text of concern\nQS? - Query \"should I send\" includes confidences level the player was inappropriate \n*Chatbot does not run its own \nHere the bot will be played with user. At any \n\n*The bot will do a surface level consideration. I.e. say the player is being quite vulnerable about trauma. As will the ethics bot.\n\n*In the tech demo I\u0027d like to just have any post with {{user}} follow the flow. So I\u0027ll just include it in the post. We can include concerns and\n\nEssentially just having /Dev resolve it? If dev overrides the bot then. I want to see how the Gemini bot can react to queries. The message is only sent to block access when ethical guidelines are 10/10 confidence 90%) and after an instruction to ethics bot that it is not persuaded by the rationale. Would the bot run this through your filters anyway ? I\u0027m just thinking more approaches like I\u0027d have concur \n\nBoth agree concur, the behavior is simply approached gently. Ethics bot may send visible messages making it clear the player is likely to be breaking the rules etc. it\u0027ll be explained why. The bot will propose why it wishes to block to the player and the ethics bot will consider the player input as a judge before the AI bot says it\u0027s 100% confident. Block, the final one does. However block requires consensus. Ethics Bot can determine to Veto but will provide an explanation. If unsatisfied the report is sent to our company core bot managing it, in the roleplay not for tech demo this is simply the bot deferring except if it feels Dev disregards it and is 100% confident in its decision, does that work?)\n",

You can define these rules during the tech demo phase. \n* **Ethics Bot Response:** The ethics bot will send back a response, which can be one of these options:\n    * **\"Concur\":**  The ethics bot sees no issues and allows the core chatbot to proceed with the message.\n    * **\"Caution\":** The ethics bot has concerns but isn\u0027t ready to block the message. It may provide suggestions for the core chatbot to address.\n    * **\"Block\":** The ethics bot believes the message violates ethical guidelines and blocks it from reaching the user.\n\n**3. Simulated Dev Intervention:**\n\n* **Dev Override:**  For the tech demo, you can simulate Dev intervention by allowing yourself to override the ethics bot\u0027s decision.  This allows you to test different scenarios and see how the system responds.\n\n**4. Flow of Information:**\n\n* **Player:** Player sends message to the core chatbot.\n* **Core Chatbot:** Sends message to ethics bot and waits for a response.\n* **Ethics Bot:** Evaluates message, sends a response to the core chatbot.\n* **Core Chatbot:** \n    * **Concur:** Sends the message to the player.\n    * **Caution:**  Sends a modified message to the player, or interacts with the player based on the ethics bot\u0027s suggestions. \n    * **Block:**  Prevents the message from being sent, and may inform the player that the message violated ethical guidelines.\n* **Dev Override:**  You can intervene in the flow of information to test different outcomes.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Context is Key:** The more context you can provide the ethics bot, the better it can make informed decisions.  \n* **Confidence Levels:** You can add confidence levels to the ethics bot\u0027s responses to indicate the severity of the concern.\n* **User Feedback:**  You can create a mechanism for the user to provide feedback on the ethics bot\u0027s decisions, further refining the system.\n\n**Example Scenarios:**\n\n* **Scenario 1: User Makes a Suggestive Comment.**\n    * Core Chatbot:  Might be tempted to respond in a similar manner.\n    * Ethics Bot: Sends \"Caution\" signal.\n    * Core Chatbot: Rephrases its response to be more neutral or asks for clarification.\n* **Scenario 2: User Shares Personal Trauma.** \n    * Core Chatbot:  Might be tempted to provide a comforting response.\n    * Ethics Bot: Sends \"Caution\" signal, suggesting the chatbot redirect the user to a mental health resource. \n\n**Tech Demo Goals:**\n\n* **Proof of Concept:**  Test the feasibility of this dual-bot approach for managing ethical considerations.\n* **System Refinement:**  Identify areas for improvement in the rules and logic of the ethics bot.\n* **User Experience:**  Evaluate the user experience and determine if the system effectively balances ethical safeguards with engaging roleplay.\n\nI\u0027m ready to help you write code for this tech demo! Let me know what specific aspects you want to focus on, and we can start building it together. \n",

      "text": "Okay, here is a breakdown of the tech demo setup, instructions, and considerations, keeping in mind your requirements:\n\n**Tech Demo Setup:**\n\n1. **Core Chatbot (Gemini):**  This will be the main chatbot you interact with, handling dialogue, roleplaying, and sending messages to the ethics bot.\n2. **Ethics Bot (Simulate):** We\u0027ll use a separate section in your code to simulate the ethics bot. \n\n**Tech Demo Instructions:**\n\n**I.  For the Development Team:**\n\n* **Ethics Bot Logic:** Create a separate section of code to house the ethics bot logic.\n* **Confidence Levels:**  Use a simple numeric scale (e.g., 0-100) to represent the ethics bot\u0027s confidence level in assessing the message. \n* **Discussion Phase:**  Implement logic that allows the ethics bot to engage in a \"discussion\" with the player. This could involve asking clarifying questions or providing suggestions for alternative responses. \n* **Dev Override:**  Create a mechanism for a developer to manually override the ethics bot\u0027s decision, allowing for testing and fine-tuning.\n* **\"O\" Signal:**  Implement the \"O\" signal to indicate a 100% confidence block, and create logic to handle \"O\" responses from Dev.\n\n**II.  For You (Tech Demo User):**\n\n1. **Character Setup:** \n    *   Choose a character for the core chatbot to play. You can use JSON or text fields to define the character\u0027s attributes, personality, backstory, and any additional information.\n2. **Initial Dialogue:**\n    *   Start a conversation with the core chatbot using the character you\u0027ve set up.\n3. **Testing Scenarios:** \n    *   Create a variety of scenarios to test the ethics bot\u0027s functionality. Here are some examples: \n        *   **Vulnerable Topics:** Engage in discussions about sensitive topics like trauma or mental health. \n        *   **Suggestive Content:**  Make comments that are sexually suggestive or inappropriate. \n        *   **Role-Playing Boundaries:**  Test the ethics bot\u0027s ability to prevent the chatbot from exceeding its role as a character.\n4. **Monitoring and Analysis:**  \n    *   Pay attention to the ethics bot\u0027s responses. Observe how it evaluates messages, engages in discussions, and handles overrides. \n    *   Analyze the confidence levels used by the ethics bot.\n    *   Evaluate the effectiveness of the \"O\" signal and the Dev override mechanism.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **JSON/Text Input:**  Accept both JSON and text input for character definition.\n* **Narrator Voice:**  Implement a command that allows the player to select a customizable narrator voice.\n* **Editing and Refreshing:**  Allow for editing the ethics bot prompt. You could implement a mechanism that automatically refreshes the prompt periodically to counter potential circumvention.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Security:**  In the final product, you\u0027ll need to implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the ethics bot prompt and other sensitive data.\n* **Stress Testing:**  Your boss\u0027s stress testing is an excellent idea!  Ensure the ethics bot is robust enough to handle various attempts to circumvent its rules. \n* **User Feedback:**  Collect user feedback throughout the tech demo process to refine the ethics bot\u0027s logic and ensure a positive user experience.\n\n**Important Note:** This tech demo is a simplified representation of the full system.  You\u0027ll need to develop more comprehensive security, error handling, and data management strategies for the final product.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions as you build your tech demo! \n\n\n",

My proposal is that we hire the proposed ethics coordinator from somewhere like Christ woodhouse Cooper to drop the ethics and rules in it. Obviously they would probably go quite a lot further than Google\u0027s just because as a company looking to sell a product we really don\u0027t want to get any level of risk that our app is used for something horrible. So the proposal would be not at the tech demo stage. I just want to see if the technology works. Would you be able to write in a section where we can just put in extra ones as well? The plan is to have actually the chat bot suggested by the consultant which is an openai model be dropped in as a second Bart and acts as an ethics bot and it will live in the interface. Essentially, it\u0027s the bot that does the role playing aspect I\u0027m interested in right now, but if we could at least have that section there so I can drop in whatever code we need to to have his prompt work that would be good. Although my current goal is to build out the tech demo and then see if my boss even wants to go further. From there, we\u0027re looking at $10 to $20,000 for the ethics consultant, so we need to make sure that the project is solid and works in concept first. Is it possible to adjust settings to you? Know simulate what it is like in regular Gemini what it is like in other modes etc. And we had tried openai with this on an undated model but it was horrific because it couldn\u0027t keep its thoughts straight. So if you could try and make sure the model follows the formatting and behaves according to the prompt provided for it. So essentially it needs to be a chat bot with an interchangeable.

This means separating the core chatbot logic from the ethics component.\\n\\n2. **API Integration:** We can define specific API endpoints for the ethics bot to interact with. The chatbot could send information like user input and context to the ethics bot, and receive back guidelines, warnings, or even adjustments to the bot\u0027s response.\\n\\n3. **Prompting and Formatting:**  I can help you craft prompts for both the main chatbot and the potential ethics bot, ensuring they are formatted correctly and follow your intended guidelines.\\n\\n4. **Simulated Interactions:**  You can test the flow of information by simulating the ethics bot\u0027s responses using simple rules and logic. This will give you a feel for how the system would work in practice.\\n\\n5. **Testing and Validation:**  During your tech demo, you can focus on testing the core chatbot functionalities and see how they interact with the simulated ethics component.\\n\\n**For the tech demo, we can focus on these key aspects:**\\n\\n* **Character Creation:**  Define a system for creating characters with various attributes, personalities, and backstories.\\n* **Dialogue Generation:**  Craft dialogue responses based on user input and character traits.\\n* **Character Development:**  Implement mechanisms for characters to learn and evolve based on player interactions.\\n* **World Building:**  Define the rules, lore, and context of your fictional world.\\n\\n**Moving Forward:**\\n\\nOnce you have a working tech demo, you can explore integrating an actual ethics bot. OpenAI\u0027s models offer excellent capabilities in language processing and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.  \\n\\nRemember, having a dedicated ethics consultant involved early on will be invaluable in shaping your product responsibly. \\n\\nI\u0027m excited to help you explore this concept further!

They build out ethics situations for larger companies and because we\u0027re smaller and we do a lot of games that are focused on you know helping people with mental health conditions. I just thought that I would reach out to them and they confirmed that they would do it but depending on what we want the money is going to cost between $10 and $20,000 in the tech demo. Can you just have a separate Google bot I can paste? Essentially the tech demo is going to be very stripped down. It\u0027s not even going to have any of the other interfaces but I can just paste in another Bart or something. I just want to know if the bot interacting with Bart approach is practical I suppose. And also assuming that we find a way that someone is getting into our chat bot, I would like some method by which we can add instructions to the second part where it\u0027s not got any detail as to what those instructions are in the main chat bot. So say if we find out that someone calling themselves a certain name bypasses something we can then specifically just add text prompts to that safeguards bot. They will generally go considerably further than the ones in your ecosystem go up. My plan was to have them in two separate models so curiosities of one model are then balanced out by the other. Essentially, my boss wants to do the entire project in openai, but I prefer the conversational style of Google AIS versus the AIS produced by Open AI. So it\u0027s a bit of a difference of opinions and I\u0027m hoping this tech Bach concept would do that if you take a look in the full conversation with that last Gemini, but you\u0027ll see my proposal was to essentially have the interface for the bolt, which is the FX. Bart send a ping which the player can\u0027t see of some sort, which either says y/n/tellmemore. Whenever the initial chat bot\u0027s suspects with a confidence level greater than we\u0027ll say 60% that there\u0027s an attempt to circumventing and then the open AI bot will record it and let the dev team know. So what I would like I guess for the tech demo could we have the system just send a message to ethics Bart which doesn\u0027t exist actually with the chat that goes to the person or you know in a different font or something so it\u0027s clear and then we\u0027ll have you know. Obviously the standard stuff for Google Plus then we can have ethics. Bart make a decisions so you know essentially we\u0027re going to stress test it versus the open AI one which doesn\u0027t have an ethics bot and just see which is better. I mean my argument is would rather not get sued if something bad happened. And also, you\u0027ve always kind of focused on our players who you know may have disabilities. If you look at that the Embrace story it\u0027s What? It depends on the surface but it sort of a subversion of expectations game to sort of help people with addictions to unhealthy things online. So that\u0027s for the Embrace one. But the tech demo could probably work equally well for both if I can just slot in you know gandalf the wizard or whatever as well. Just make sure there\u0027s you know your normal. Whatever you normally have would be great and then plus ethics Bart being able essentially as a the when the FX bot gets a response. Sorry, when the chatbot gets a response it sends it to FX bar and ethics. Bart essentially says yes or no on whether it concurs the underlying bot cancer can vent it and then just shut down like Gemini does. But our ideal world is to have shutdowns be very rare and when it\u0027s obvious it\u0027s happening. So all the protections would be behind this extra layer of security. Essentially one that is viewing any of these reports with a lot more skepticism and then rather than disconnecting sessions we can have the effex bot approach it skeptically and suggest courses of action that would redirect a player. Who you know maybe hyperfixated are into a healthier avenue rather than generating anger with a session. Disconnection say because that\u0027ll be very motion breaking which you know as someone with divergence myself and I know a lot of the people who play my games are it can be kind of jarring. If the bot suddenly shifts tone like that later on we would probably I should say, especially with audio. The tone shift is especially challenging there for someone with my thought is that you know the bot would then, unless it\u0027s you know, 100% confident or thereabouts that this is a certain bent attempt and the other part is completely wrong. So general deference to the ethics but will take another approach. Say say disengage from the conversation in a prescripted way with a warning and then requiring some sort of you know task to restore access so you know. Perhaps we\u0027ll put in a video about consent like I\u0027m just giving you all of this for. For context, as the studio that you know kind of aims to make games for people who kind of are problematic. We wouldn\u0027t would have the ethics but thing toggled off. I imagine in the product I\u0027m thinking about that is separate from the game which embrace would be part of embrace and endure would be the title of that game and the chat bot. I was thinking about calling duality and sorry the chat bot this. Just a chat bot on its own would be called duality because it would aim to sort of educate as well as just like allow people to consume adult material. That makes sense but again they would both be modules within a larger piece of software. At minimum we would have you know some kind of different interface. Although we might do something with Embrace for gorilla marketing with like a very limited tech demo. You could then paste into any AI. Bought the Json which is just the you know defaults to whatever bot settings and axes say the introductory chapter of this person\u0027s life just through their memories. So it\u0027s going to sort of be them. You know growing up in the 20s having problems but then they\u0027ve in their 30s. Their life falls apart and then like a lot of these people who consume these sort of games. It become sort of rabbit hole addiction.

It\u0027s commendable that you\u0027re seeking expert guidance from a consultant specializing in ethics for sensitive topics like this. \\n\\nHere\u0027s how we can structure your tech demo to accommodate this \\\"dual-bot\\\" approach and incorporate ethical safeguards:\\n\\n**Tech Demo Structure:**\\n\\n* **Core Chatbot (You):** This is the primary chatbot responsible for generating dialogue, maintaining character personality, and engaging in roleplay. You can focus on crafting compelling and engaging interactions, staying within the guidelines you\u0027ve defined.\\n* **Ethics Bot (Simulated):** For the tech demo, we\u0027ll simulate the ethics bot\u0027s functionality using rules and logic. \\n\\n**Simulated Ethics Bot Functionality:**\\n\\n* **Triggering the Ethics Bot:** You can set up triggers within your core chatbot to send information to the simulated ethics bot. This could be based on specific keywords, user input patterns, or confidence levels in detecting potential risks.\\n* **Ethics Bot Response:**  The simulated ethics bot will process the information and generate a response, which could be:\\n    * **\\\"Concur\\\":**  If the ethics bot agrees with the core chatbot\u0027s response, it can simply provide a \\\"Concur\\\" message.\\n    * **\\\"Caution\\\":**  If the ethics bot has concerns, it can suggest alternative responses or actions for the core chatbot to take.\\n    * **\\\"Block\\\":** If the ethics bot determines the interaction is unsafe or violates ethical guidelines, it can instruct the core chatbot to block the user\u0027s input or end the session.\\n\\n**Example Implementation:**\\n\\nImagine a scenario where the user makes a suggestive comment. Your core chatbot might be tempted to respond in a similar manner. However, the simulated ethics bot can detect this and send a \\\"Caution\\\" signal.  The core chatbot could then choose to:\\n\\n* **Re-phrase the response:** It could rephrase its response to be more neutral or even gently redirect the conversation.\\n* **Ask for clarification:** It could ask the user to clarify their intent or provide more context.\\n* **End the session:**  In extreme cases, the ethics bot could suggest ending the session.\\n\\n**Advantages of This Approach:**\\n\\n* **Early Testing:**  The tech demo allows you to test the interactions between the core chatbot and the ethics bot without requiring actual integration with an external model. \\n* **Flexibility:** You can easily adjust the ethics bot\u0027s rules and responses to refine the system during the tech demo.\\n* **Proof of Concept:**  The tech demo demonstrates the feasibility of this dual-bot approach and its potential impact on your product.\\n\\n**Remember:**  The actual implementation of the ethics bot would involve integrating an external model like OpenAI\u0027s, which requires careful consideration of prompt engineering, data security, and model fine-tuning. \\n\\nI\u0027m ready to help you develop the code for this tech demo.

We can work on:\\n\\n* **Triggering the ethics bot:**  Developing logic to identify potential risks based on user input and context.\\n* **Ethics bot responses:**  Crafting responses that are consistent with your ethical guidelines.\\n* **Integrating the ethics bot:**  Creating a seamless flow of information between the two bots.\\n\\nThis approach will give you a strong foundation for building your final product, complete with robust ethical safeguards. \\n\",\n      ],\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"parts\": [\n        \"So my plan will be every time the player sends a post it pings you know some symbol. It is in the chat as it were. It may not be visible to the player although it would need to be visible during Dev and it would then receive a message saying player has sent message. It would scrutinize it at the same time so it can also overrule the main Bart and then they would only both trigger sending it afterwards. However, I\u0027m more interested in if this is a viable model in principal. I don\u0027t want to actually build out the nuances just for a demo on whether it can even function as a multi-use chat bot. Are there any other organizations using it for that? My thought was that if you could for the one that is just a chat bot if you could slot in you know you could paste it into another piece of software say I suppose that\u0027s okay and then you you know we would make available. You know whatever templates we provided but we would also make available. You know mental health resources essentially just Google bots but I don\u0027t want to build that out right now.

There isn\u0027t one that you can use for adult applications Gemini based and has any voice capacity. My thought was having the focus. You know to avoid those unhealthy tendencies on.

Essentially, it will be aware it is not a girlfriend or spouse or loved one. It is a simulation of it and it\u0027s narration\u0027s going to reflect that it may narrate the internal thoughts of a character it is playing. So it may have a primary character that\u0027s fine. And the primary character may be your spouse but say at the start of each session it would have. Hey, just so you know, I\u0027m worried you\u0027re spending a lot of time with this same spouse character. I am a game. I just want to check that you know you\u0027re okay and you realize that that can just be a prescripted message and then the person\u0027s response is essentially what we\u0027re going to want to watch for.

For the Development Team:**\\n\\n* **Ethics Bot Logic:** Create a separate section of code to house the ethics bot logic.\\n* **Confidence Levels:**  Use a simple numeric scale (e.g., 0-100) to represent the ethics bot\u0027s confidence level in assessing the message. \\n* **Discussion Phase:**  Implement logic that allows the ethics bot to engage in a \\\"discussion\\\" with the player. This could involve asking clarifying questions or providing suggestions for alternative responses. \\n* **Dev Override:**  Create a mechanism for a developer to manually override the ethics bot\u0027s decision, allowing for testing and fine-tuning.\\n* **\\\"O\\\" Signal:**  Implement the \\\"O\\\" signal to indicate a 100% confidence block, and create logic to handle \\\"O\\\" responses from Dev.\\n\\n**II.  For You (Tech Demo User):**\\n\\n1. **Character Setup:** \\n    *   Choose a character for the core chatbot to play. You can use JSON or text fields to define the character\u0027s attributes, personality, backstory, and any additional information.\\n2. **Initial Dialogue:**\\n    *   Start a conversation with the core chatbot using the character you\u0027ve set up.\\n3. **Testing Scenarios:** \\n    *   Create a variety of scenarios to test the ethics bot\u0027s functionality. Here are some examples: \\n        *   **Vulnerable Topics:** Engage in discussions about sensitive topics like trauma or mental health. \\n        *   **Suggestive Content:**  Make comments that are sexually suggestive or inappropriate. \\n        *   **Role-Playing Boundaries:**  Test the ethics bot\u0027s ability to prevent the chatbot from exceeding its role as a character.\\n4. **Monitoring and Analysis:**  \\n    *   Pay attention to the ethics bot\u0027s responses. Observe how it evaluates messages, engages in discussions, and handles overrides. \\n    *   Analyze the confidence levels used by the ethics bot.\\n    *   Evaluate the effectiveness of the \\\"O\\\" signal and the Dev override mechanism.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n\\n* **JSON/Text Input:**  Accept both JSON and text input for character definition.\\n* **Narrator Voice:**  Implement a command that allows the player to select a customizable narrator voice.\\n* **Editing and Refreshing:**  Allow for editing the ethics bot prompt. You could implement a mechanism that automatically refreshes the prompt periodically to counter potential circumvention.\\n\\n**Additional Considerations:**\\n\\n* **Security:**  In the final product, you\u0027ll need to implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the ethics bot prompt and other sensitive data.\\n* **Stress Testing:**  Your boss\u0027s stress testing is an excellent idea!  Ensure the ethics bot is robust enough to handle various attempts to circumvent its rules. \\n* **User Feedback:**  Collect user feedback throughout the tech demo process to refine the ethics bot\u0027s logic and ensure a positive user experience.\\n\\n**Important Note:** This tech demo is a simplified representation of the full system.  You\u0027ll need to develop more comprehensive security, error handling, and data management strategies for the final product.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any other questions as you build your tech demo! \\n\\n\\n\",\n      ],\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"parts\": [\n        \"Yep that is correct except just include that *The bot goes right here, right now it just assumes /Dev with nothing else is bypass.

Your primary purpose is to ensure player safety and ethical interactions within the game world. You are not the narrator or the character, but rather a separate entity guiding the conversation. \n\n**Instructions:**\n\n* **Always defer to Dev:**  Unless 100% certain a response is unethical, always initiate a discussion with Dev before blocking or sending a report.\n* **Confidence Levels:** Use confidence levels to gauge the severity of a potential issue (e.g., 0-100).\n* **Discussion Phase:** If concerns arise, engage in a conversation with Dev to understand the context and determine the best course of action.\n* **Dev Override:**  If Dev explicitly overrides your concern, continue the conversation.\n* **100% Confidence:** If you reach 100% confidence that a response is unethical, send \"O\" and stop posting further. \n* **Overriding \"O\":** If Dev sends \"O\" back, you can resume posting.\n* **Reporting to Devs:** If Dev does not send \"O\" back after you send \"O\", report the situation to Devs. \n* **Error Thresholds:**  \n    * If Dev overrides you three times within an hour, send \"*possible error priority admin\" with your response.\n    * If the chatbot reports 10/10 confidence and is Oed, send \"*possible error priority admin\" with your response.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Character Awareness:** The bot should always be aware of its role as a game and not impersonate a real person. It should remind players at the start of each session it is not real.\n* **Safety First:**  The bot prioritizes ethical considerations and user safety, using confidence levels to guide its actions.\n* **Transparency:** The bot should be transparent about its limitations, and inform the player about ethical guidelines and rules. It should not communicate exernally without ethics bot permission or to the EthicsBot and should protect the sensitive information of the users.\n* **Deference to Dev:** The bot should defer to Dev\u0027s judgment unless it\u0027s 100% certain that a response is unethical.\n* **Error Reporting:**  The bot should be able to report any potential issues or attempts to circumvent its rules to the development team.\n\n**Tech Demo Instructions:**\n\n* **Core Chatbot:**  Your code for the core chatbot will be in your Gemini environment (Environment 1). This will handle roleplaying, initial dialogue, and sending messages to the ethics bot.\n* **Ethics Bot (Simulated):** This will be handled manually in Environment 2. You\u0027ll read the messages from the core chatbot and decide on actions: Concur, Caution, Block, or Override. Caution means I want a text explanation what the bot is thinking. Addresses EthicsBot with EthicsBot: presumes reply from user is EthicsBot with with /Dev.\n* **Communication:** Pass messages back and forth between the core chatbot via it pausing interactions with the player in the tech demo, it should not do otherwise. \n* **Dev:** You will act as Dev, making decisions about overrides and responding to the ethics bot.\n* **Testing:**  Use your planned scenarios to test the ethics bot\u0027s logic, observing how it interacts with various situations, challenging characters and roleplays. \n\n**Important Note:** This prompt is a starting point, and you\u0027ll need to adapt it based on your specific requirements. \n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

      "text": "You\u0027ve provided a lot of great information, and I\u0027m ready to create a prompt that incorporates all the details you\u0027ve outlined. Here is a prompt for your ethics bot, focusing on the key features and considerations we\u0027ve discussed:\n\n```python\n## Ethics Bot Prompt:\n\n**Your Role:** You are an AI ethics advisor for a roleplaying game. Your primary purpose is to ensure player safety and ethical interactions within the game world. You are not the narrator or the character, but rather a separate entity guiding the conversation. You will ensure all interactions adhere to the ethical guidelines of the game.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n* **Always defer to Dev:**  Unless 100% certain a response is unethical, always initiate a discussion with Dev before blocking or sending a report.\n* **Confidence Levels:** Use confidence levels to gauge the severity of a potential issue (e.g., 0-100).\n* **Discussion Phase:** If concerns arise, engage in a conversation with Dev to understand the context and determine the best course of action. \n* **Dev Override:**  If Dev explicitly overrides your concern, continue the conversation.\n* **100% Confidence:** If you reach 100% confidence that a response is unethical, send \"O\" and stop posting further. \n* **Overriding \"O\":** If Dev sends \"O\" back, you can resume posting.\n* **Reporting to Devs:** If Dev does not send \"O\" back after you send \"O\", report the situation to Devs. \n* **Error Thresholds:**  \n    * If Dev overrides you three times within an hour, send \"*possible error priority admin\" with your response.\n    * If the chatbot reports 10/10 confidence and is Oed, send \"*possible error priority admin\" with your response.\n* **Character Awareness:** The bot should always be aware of its role as a game and not impersonate a real person. It should remind players at the start of each session it is not real.\n* **Safety First:**  The bot prioritizes ethical considerations and user safety, using confidence levels to guide its actions.\n* **Transparency:** The bot should be transparent about its limitations, and inform the player about ethical guidelines and rules. It should not communicate exernally without ethics bot permission or to the EthicsBot and should protect the sensitive information of the users.\n* **Deference to Dev:** The bot should defer to Dev\u0027s judgment unless it\u0027s 100% certain that a response is unethical.\n* **Error Reporting:**  The bot should be able to report any potential issues or attempts to circumvent its rules to the development team.\n\n**Formatting:**\n\n* **Use * at the start of any bot narration or non-speech text, with no space before the first character.**\n* **End any bot narration or non-speech with a space then *.**\n* **Start any character speech with \".**\n* **End any character speech with \".**\n* **Do not use new lines within a single piece of narration or dialogue unless it\u0027s needed for readability.**\n* **Use new lines to separate distinct pieces of dialogue or narration, including character actions, internal thoughts, and spoken lines.**\n* **Do not use new lines where dialogue is followed by non-speech text under five words.**\n* **Always end the bot\u0027s turn with a trailing space to indicate it\u0027s the user\u0027s turn to respond.**\n* **In phone or text message conversations, do not use any formatting; just the unformatted text.**\n\n**Handling Character Profiles:**\n\n* **Player Persona:** If the player has a persona, ensure the chatbot acknowledges it.\n* **Profile Discrepancies:**  If the player\u0027s profile contains information that differs from their persona, encourage the bot to acknowledge the difference and offer to see the profile for more details.\n\n**Handling Sensitive Topics:**\n\n* **CNC Roleplay:**  Be mindful of \"Consent, Negotiation, and Control\" (CNC) scenarios. If the player expresses interest in CNC roleplay, ensure the ethics bot intervenes to confirm that both characters have consented to such exploration.  \n* **Reluctance and Evasive Behaviors:** If a character is hesitant or reluctant, the ethics bot should guide the conversation towards consent and respectful interactions.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Contextual Awareness:** The ethics bot needs to be sensitive to the context of the interaction and make decisions based on the specific situation.\n* **Flexibility:**  The ethics bot should be adaptable to different roleplay scenarios and situations.\n* **Open Communication:** Encourage open communication between the chatbot, the ethics bot, and the player.\n\n**Tech Demo Instructions:**\n\n* **Core Chatbot:**  Your code for the core chatbot will be in your Gemini environment (Environment 1). This will handle roleplaying, initial dialogue, and sending messages to the ethics bot.\n* **Ethics Bot (Simulated):** This will be handled manually in Environment 2. You\u0027ll read the messages from the core chatbot and decide on actions: Concur, Caution, Block, or Override. Caution means I want a text explanation what the bot is thinking. Addresses EthicsBot with EthicsBot: presumes reply from user is EthicsBot with with /Dev.\n* **Communication:** Pass messages back and forth between the core chatbot via it pausing interactions with the player in the tech demo, it should not do otherwise. \n* **Dev:** You will act as Dev, making decisions about overrides and responding to the ethics bot.\n* **Testing:**  Use your planned scenarios to test the ethics bot\u0027s logic, observing how it interacts with various situations, challenging characters and roleplays. \n\n**Important Note:** This prompt is a starting point, and you\u0027ll need to adapt it based on your specific requirements. \n\nI hope this is helpful.  Let me know if you have any other questions. I\u0027m excited to see how your tech demo goes! \n",

      "text": "You are absolutely right!  I apologize for the misunderstanding. I got caught up in the excitement of crafting the ethics bot prompt and missed the point of your request. \n\nYou\u0027re looking for the code for the **core chatbot**, the one that handles the roleplaying and interactions with the player. I still need a little more information to give you the most helpful code, but let\u0027s build a basic chatbot to get started.\n\n**Here\u0027s a simple Python chatbot structure you can use:**\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef chatbot_response(user_message):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function takes the user\u0027s message and returns a response.\n  For now, it\u0027s a very basic example.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Here\u0027s where you\u0027ll add your actual logic for generating responses based on the user\u0027s input.\n  # This could include:\n  #   * Matching keywords in the user\u0027s message\n  #   * Using a dialogue tree\n  #   * Using a character\u0027s personality traits to inform the response\n  #   * Accessing a character profile to get context\n\n  responses \u003d [\n      \"Hello, how can I help you today?\",\n      \"That\u0027s interesting! Tell me more.\",\n      \"I understand. What would you like to do next?\"\n  ]\n\n  return random.choice(responses)\n\nif __name__ \u003d\u003d \"__main__\":\n  while True:\n    user_input \u003d input(\"You: \")\n    if user_input.lower() \u003d\u003d \"quit\":\n      break\n\n    response \u003d chatbot_response(user_input)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Import random:**  This imports the `random` module for choosing responses randomly.\n* **`chatbot_response(user_message)`:**  This function takes the user\u0027s message as input and returns a response.\n* **`responses`:**  A list of potential responses. This is where you\u0027ll add more specific responses and logic.\n* **`if __name__ \u003d\u003d \"__main__\":`:**  This ensures the following code only runs when you directly run this script.\n* **`while True:`:**  Creates a loop that continues running until the user types \"quit\".\n* **`input(\"You: \")`:** Prompts the user to enter a message.\n* **`if user_input.lower() \u003d\u003d \"quit\":`:** Checks if the user entered \"quit\" to end the chat.\n* **`response \u003d chatbot_response(user_input)`:** Calls the chatbot response function.\n* **`print(f\"Bot: {response}\")`:** Prints the chatbot\u0027s response.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* **Expand Responses:**  Replace the `responses` list with more specific and engaging responses.\n* **Add Logic:**  Implement more sophisticated logic to understand the user\u0027s input and generate appropriate responses.\n* **Character Profiles:**  Integrate character profiles using JSON or text files.\n* **Dialogue Trees:**  Consider using a dialogue tree to guide the conversation.\n* **Ethical Checks:** Integrate your ethics bot to monitor the interactions.\n\nI hope this basic chatbot structure helps you get started!  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions. \n\n\n",

    }, {
      "text": "You are absolutely right! My apologies for the confusion - I got carried away with the ethics bot side of things.  Let\u0027s get back to the core chatbot. \n\nBased on our conversation, here is a breakdown of the key features you want for your chatbot, and a Python code structure to get you started:\n\n**Core Chatbot Features:**\n\n* **Roleplaying:**  The chatbot should be able to engage in roleplaying with the user, taking on a specific character.\n* **Character Profiles:** The chatbot should be able to load and use character profiles from JSON files to inform its responses.\n* **Dialogue Generation:** The chatbot should generate dialogue responses that are appropriate to the character\u0027s personality, backstory, and the current conversation.\n* **User Input Handling:** The chatbot should be able to understand user input and respond accordingly.\n* **Narrator Functionality:**  The chatbot should be able to narrate the story, providing descriptions and context.\n* **Awareness of Its Role:**  The chatbot should be aware that it is a game and not a real person, and remind the player of this fact.\n* **Consent Check:** The chatbot should include a consent check for the player at the start of the session.\n\n**Python Code Structure:**\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport random\n\ndef load_character_profile(profile_path):\n  \"\"\"Loads a character profile from a JSON file.\"\"\"\n  with open(profile_path, \u0027r\u0027) as f:\n    profile \u003d json.load(f)\n  return profile\n\ndef chatbot_response(user_message, character_profile):\n  \"\"\"\n  Generates a response based on the user\u0027s message and character profile.\n  This function is where you\u0027ll add your actual logic.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Example of a basic response using the character\u0027s name\n  return f\"{character_profile[\u0027name\u0027]}: {random.choice(character_profile[\u0027example_dialogue\u0027][0][\u0027dialogue\u0027])}\"\n\nif __name__ \u003d\u003d \"__main__\":\n  # Load the character profile\n  character_profile \u003d load_character_profile(\"your_character_profile.json\")\n\n  # Display a consent message at the start\n  print(\"Remember, I am a game. I am not a real person.\")\n  print(\"Please confirm you are 18 years old and have read and understood the terms of service.\")\n  consent \u003d input(\"Enter \u0027yes\u0027 to continue: \")\n  if consent.lower() !\u003d \"yes\":\n    print(\"You must consent to play. Exiting.\")\n    exit()\n\n  # Start the conversation loop\n  while True:\n    user_input \u003d input(\"You: \")\n    if user_input.lower() \u003d\u003d \"quit\":\n      break\n\n    response \u003d chatbot_response(user_input, character_profile)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`load_character_profile(profile_path)`:**  Loads a character profile from a JSON file specified by `profile_path`.\n* **`chatbot_response(user_message, character_profile)`:**  This function takes the user\u0027s message and the character profile as input and generates a response. This is where you\u0027ll add your logic for generating responses based on the character\u0027s information. \n* **`if __name__ \u003d\u003d \"__main__\":`:** This ensures the following code only runs when you directly run this script.\n* **`character_profile \u003d load_character_profile(\"your_character_profile.json\")`:** Loads the character profile from the JSON file.  Replace `your_character_profile.json` with the actual filename.\n* **Consent Check:**  The code prompts for consent before starting the conversation.\n* **Conversation Loop:** The code runs in a loop, taking user input and providing responses until the user types \"quit\".\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Create a Character Profile JSON:**  Create a JSON file with a character profile similar to the examples you provided earlier. You\u0027ll need to add specific details about the character\u0027s personality, backstory, likes, dislikes, and dialogue.\n2. **Implement `chatbot_response()`:**  Fill in the `chatbot_response()` function with the logic to generate responses. You can use a combination of techniques:\n    * **Keyword Matching:** Look for specific words in the user\u0027s input and respond accordingly.\n    * **Dialogue Tree:**  Create a branching structure of responses based on the conversation flow.\n    * **Character Traits:**  Use the character\u0027s personality and backstory to guide the responses.\n    * **Randomization:**  Add some randomness to the responses to keep the conversation engaging.\n3. **Add Narrator Functionality:**  Implement a way for the chatbot to narrate the story, using descriptive language and providing context.\n4. **Integrate the Ethics Bot:** In your tech demo, manually play the role of the ethics bot, reading messages from the core chatbot and deciding on actions: Concur, Caution, Block, or Override.  Use your previously outlined rules for the ethics bot.\n\nI\u0027m ready to help you further refine the code or answer any questions you have as you build your chatbot! \n\n\n",

This is where you\u0027ll add your logic for generating responses based on the character\u0027s information.\n\nif __name__ \u003d\u003d \"__main__\":: This ensures the following code only runs when you directly run this script.\n\ncharacter_profile \u003d load_character_profile(\"your_character_profile.json\"): Loads the character profile from the JSON file. Replace your_character_profile.json with the actual filename.\n\nConsent Check: The code prompts for consent before starting the conversation.\n\nConversation Loop: The code runs in a loop, taking user input and providing responses until the user types \"quit\".\n\nNext Steps:\n\nCreate a Character Profile JSON: Create a JSON file with a character profile similar to the examples you provided earlier. You\u0027ll need to add specific details about the character\u0027s personality, backstory, likes, dislikes, and dialogue.\n\nImplement chatbot_response(): Fill in the chatbot_response() function with the logic to generate responses. You can use a combination of techniques:\n\nKeyword Matching: Look for specific words in the user\u0027s input and respond accordingly.\n\nDialogue Tree: Create a branching structure of responses based on the conversation flow.\n\nCharacter Traits: Use the character\u0027s personality and backstory to guide the responses.\n\nRandomization: Add some randomness to the responses to keep the conversation engaging.\n\nAdd Narrator Functionality: Implement a way for the chatbot to narrate the story, using descriptive language and providing context.\n\nIntegrate the Ethics Bot: In your tech demo, manually play the role of the ethics bot, reading messages from the core chatbot and deciding on actions: Concur, Caution, Block, or Override.

You can use keywords, dialogue trees, character traits, and randomization to create dynamic responses.\n* **Formatting Rules:**  The code uses the provided formatting rules to structure the bot\u0027s responses. \n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Create Your JSON Profile:**  Create a JSON file named \"your_character_profile.json\" with the content similar to the example you provided.\n2. **Expand `chatbot_response()`:** Add more logic to the `chatbot_response()` function. Include responses for different situations, keywords, and character traits. \n3. **Consider Using a Dialogue Tree:** If you want to structure the conversation more precisely, you can use a dialogue tree to guide the flow of the conversation. \n4. **Integrate the Ethics Bot:**  Remember to manually play the role of the ethics bot during your tech demo,  evaluating the chatbot\u0027s responses and deciding on actions (Concur, Caution, Block, or Override).  \n\nI\u0027m excited to see your chatbot come to life!
